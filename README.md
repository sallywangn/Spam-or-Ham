## Introduction
"Spam or Ham" is a machine learning project aimed at identifying spam emails. We investigate if a machine learning model can accurately predict and effectively differentiate spam from non-spam emails.

## The Dataset
Utilizing the "Email Spam Classification Dataset CSV" from Kaggle, which includes 5172 labeled email samples, we explore insights and patterns about spam emails.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Process
1. Gathering and preprocessing a dataset of labeled emails.
2. Training a machine learning model to classify emails.
3. Analyzing and visualizing the data to understand the characteristics of spam emails.

## Results
We achieved high accuracy in spam email prediction using a supervised learning model, particularly SVM (Support Vector Machine).

## Challenges and Learning
Our journey included designing accurate models, effective teamwork, and visual storytelling.
